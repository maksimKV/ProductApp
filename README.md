# Product App
A product application built in ASP.NET MVC. The app uses api data from bestbuy.com and it displays produc catalogue with information about the items. The app also uses some JavaScript plugins to enhance user experience. I have made the front end design to the best of my ability. There are also unit test included.

### Pages:
- Homepage (product list & search
- Product detail page (info about one product) 

1. The Homepage will have a search text input where the user can search for any BestBuy product (e.g. Mobile Devices as iPhones, HTCs, Samsung...) within any category or a category you prefer, once the search button on the keyboard, or the search button on the screen has been pressed, you need to search for those products and return to step 2. 

2. Once the products are returned, you will then need to present them as a list with the following information:
	* Product Thumbnail.
	* Product Name.
	* Product Price.
	 
	When the user presses on any item within the list go to step 3 (Product detail page).
	Using pagination to display and infinite scrolling list is a plus.

3. The Product detail page should display the details of the product as follows:
	* Product Image, bigger than the Thumbnail.
	* Product Name.
	* Product Price.
	* If the product is on sale, should show sale price, with the regular price crossed out.
	* Number of reviews of the product by customers.
	* Review average score.
	* Product Description.
	* A horizontal grid of 3 related products.
	* A horizontal grid of 3 accessories.

## Plus point

* Pagination or load more for the products list
* Use of design priciples
* Animations
* Unit Testing
